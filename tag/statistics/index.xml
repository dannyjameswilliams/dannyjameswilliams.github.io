&lt;p&gt;The notion of &lt;em&gt;true random&lt;/em&gt; has perplexed scientists and statisticians for decades, if not longer. But there’s one process that we still don’t know much about - the human brain. What is it that causes our decisions to be made? When we are asked to ‘pick a random number between 1 and 10’, how ‘random’ is the number we give? Is it some complicated, deterministic signal of neurons in our brain? Or is it actually random?&lt;/p&gt;
Here is the keyboard heatmap

&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you remember the ‘trick’ that your friend would play on you as a kid in the playground. They would ask you the following questions: ‘4+2’, ‘3+3’ and ‘5+1’, and then ask you to &lt;em&gt;name a vegetable&lt;/em&gt;. You would inevitably say ‘carrot’, then they’d reveal a piece of paper with the word ‘carrot’ on it. Were you truly tricked? Turns out, if you’re asked to name a vegetable, &lt;a href=&#34;http://sciencechatforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=264070&#34;&gt;most people say carrot regardless&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not a trick, when asked to name something at random, we pick an extremely common vegetable.&lt;/p&gt;
