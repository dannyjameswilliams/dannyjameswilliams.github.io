      <title>Chicago Crime Classification</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My most recent project was a group project as part of the first term of the COMPASS CDT. It involved modelling different aspects of a large data set detailing crimes in Chicago. Pictured is a kernel density estimate of both the location of crimes in the city as well as the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My input to this project was to use logistic regression methods to classify whether an arrest would be successful or not, given other covariates in the crime set; detailing the location, the area, the type of crime type, amongst others. This involved feature engineering and using LASSO coefficient paths to judge the most &amp;lsquo;important&amp;rsquo; covariates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package that was created for this project can be found as a Github repository 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jakespiteri/chicagocrime&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Downscaling Extremes of Precipitation in the South West</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my Masters dissertation project, I used extreme value theory to model the extremes of precipitation across the South West of the UK, and downscale sparse areas using a numerical weather model on a gridded scale. Pictured is the high resolution elevation levels across the South West, with a grid that samples the same elevation levels every 0.25 degrees in longitude and latitude. This highlights one of the problems with downscaling in such a scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extreme values of rainfall can be categorised by their maxima, and using a generalised extreme value (GEV) distribution, these maxima can be modelled. I modelled two sets of maxima separately; for the observations (point locations) and the model output (gridded locations). A separate downscaling generalised additive model (GAM) was used to compare predictions from both models, and link them together using various covariates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more about this project in my final dissertation, which can be found
