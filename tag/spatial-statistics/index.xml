      <title>Chicago Crime Classification</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My most recent project was a group project as part of the first term of the COMPASS CDT. It involved modelling different aspects of a large data set detailing crimes in Chicago. Pictured is a kernel density estimate of both the location of crimes in the city as well as the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My input to this project was to use logistic regression methods to classify whether an arrest would be successful or not, given other covariates in the crime set; detailing the location, the area, the type of crime type, amongst others. This involved feature engineering and using LASSO coefficient paths to judge the most &amp;lsquo;important&amp;rsquo; covariates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package that was created for this project can be found as a Github repository 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jakespiteri/chicagocrime&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
