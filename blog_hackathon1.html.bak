        <h2 id="subheading">Electricity Demand Forecasting Hackathon</h2>
        <div>
          <p>In February I participated in a COMPASS hackathon, where me and my
            fellow students fit statistical models to try to improve predictions
            in forecasting electricity demand based on weather related
            variables. </p>
          <p>We were fortunate to be visited by Dr Jethro Browell, a Research
            Fellow at the University of Strathclyde, who gave a brief lecture on
            how electricity demand was calculated, and how much it has changed
            over the last decade. After the lecture, Dr Mateo Fasiolo, a
            lecturer who works with us, explained a basic Generalised Additive
            Model (GAM) which can be used to forecast electricity demand for a
            particular dataset. </p>
          <p> Our task was to output a set of predictions for a testing dataset
            and submit them to the group git repository. We only had access to
            the predictor variables of this dataset, so we wouldn't know how
            well our model was doing until it was submit and checked by Dr
            Fasiolo, who then put all submitted scores on the projector at the
            front of the room. The team with the lowest root mean squared error
            at the end would be crowned the winner. </p>

              cohort after participating in the hackathon, with Dr Jethro
              Browell and Dr Mateo Fasiolo in the front.</figcaption> </figure>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Me and my team "Jim" (named so because we went to the gym)
            performed well at the start, extending the basic GAM to include
            additional covariates and interactions, as well as including some
            feature engineering. The second team "AGang" (because all of their
            names began with "A") took the edge over us by removing a single
            variable that we didn't realise was actually making our model worse,
            and their GAM produced better predictions overall by a small margin.
            The third team "D &amp; D" (because both their names began with a D)
            was having no luck at all, trying to implement a random forest model
            as opposed to a GAM, but their predictions were significantly off,
            and their code took much longer to run than ours, leaving them with
            little time to troubleshoot. </p>
          <p> Try as we did, we were unable to do any better than our original
            model; but we limited our scope to a GAM, and did not try anything
            out-of-the-box compared to the other two teams. </p>
          <p> The "AGang" were set to win it, until a surprise twist of fate
            sent "D&amp;D" soaring into the lead, with predictions that had a
            far smaller error than anyone elses. The random forest model they
            were fitting before had an error, and they managed to fix the error,
            finish running the model and submit their predictions with only
            moments to spare. Thus, we came last. </p>
          <p> This was a fun competition, even though we lost. I realise that
            our mistake now was that we did not include anything special in our
            model that accounted for different weather patterns in different
            regions. Our model would have done very well if it was more
            variable; so that certain predictors were included in some areas
            that had more solar power, for instance. The way which we fit the
            model was the same for all regions, even though they were all quite
            different. </p>
